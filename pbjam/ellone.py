""" Detect l=1 ridges

This is a basic module for detecting the l=1 modes in a spectrum. 

It attempts to find the l=1 ridge by using a clustering function on frequency
bins that are inconsistent with noise at a ~10% probability (H0 test).

It uses the output from the pbjam.peakbag module, where the best-fit models for
the l=2,0 modes is divided out, to form a residual spectrum. This is used in 
the following to detect the l=1 ridge under the assumption that the remaining
significant peaks are most likely caused by l=1 modes (not l=3).

Several levels of binning are applied and the H0 test is performed at each
level. Peaks that persist at many levels of binning will be picked up by 
Hdbscan (unsupervised clustering algorithm), and the average frequencies of the 
clusters are taken to be an estimate of the l=1 frequencies. 

The frequency range between l=0 and l=2, for a given n, is searched for the
cluster with the largest number of samples, and it is assumed that this is
the l=1 ridge. Only 1 l=1 mode is picked up for each radial order, i.e., 
mixed modes are not considered. 

Note
----
It is recommended that pbjam.peakbag be run prior to using this module.
